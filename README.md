Hi there 👋  
I'm **Jean-Jacques**, a South African developer currently living in France, working under the banner of **PsionicAlch** as a freelancer and consultant. I've been programming since 2018, and focused on **Golang** development since 2020.

Though I've jumped around from web to mobile to game dev over the years, it’s given me a broad understanding of the software landscape and helped me build versatile, solid systems. These days, I mostly build backend-heavy platforms with Go, usually with a sprinkle of Docker, Linux, SQLite, and the occasional frontend flair (ReactJS, SvelteKit, etc.).

## 🚀 Projects Worth Noting

Here are a few projects I'm proud of:

### 🔹 [Course Platform](https://github.com/PsionicAlch/course-platform)  
A full-stack course platform built from scratch in Go – including a fully custom authentication system. Yes, I’m that kind of nerd.

### 🔹 [Sitemapper](https://github.com/PsionicAlch/sitemapper)  
My first Golang library: generates sitemaps by periodically crawling websites. Comes with documentation *and* tests. I was proud.

### 🔹 [Byteforge](https://github.com/PsionicAlch/byteforge)  
A growing collection of abstract data types and utility functions in Go. Think of it as my attempt to bottle some Go magic.

## 💡 Philosophy

I write code to solve real problems, and occasionally just to see if I can.  
I believe software is equal parts logic and intuition, with some creativity sprinkled on top.
